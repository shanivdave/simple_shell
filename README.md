This shell is an interactive commandline interpreter. This shell that we created utilizes the command line interface (CLI). It allows users to type in a defined set of commands (e.g. "env" to print out the environment, "rm" to remove files, "ls" to list file in the current directory, etc) and have the operating system run the appropriate function. Our shell is a simple version that handles memory leaks very well and has basic functionality. It allows the user to manipulate folders however they want, from writing, reading, etc, print things to the terminal, change directories, print where you are in the system, among others.

Synopsis

On this Simple Shell repository it holds all the code necessary for our custom simple shell to run. Our shell currently handles the executions of executables found in the environmental variable PATH. Some of the commands that our shell supports include /bin/ls, pwd, env, etc.
